first of all sir,

1- i have implement the requirement number 6 .
2- i have implemented the file manipulation library which uses binary files in order 
to save the data after the application is terminated - but the functionality is done 
correctly and it is generic as it can be .
names fileManipulation.h   fileManipulation.c \
I inteneded to use it for requirement number 6 but i didn't have the time to do so ,
unfortunately .
3- i have implemented the stack genricly as every node of the stack can take any dataType
not a specific datatype that will be supported a stack can have its nodes with different dataTypes

4- i have made s separate file for req2 and req4 

5- i have constructed the application and the test cases for every library implemented
inside the mainApplication.c file 

6- for requirement number 6 i created a separate file it is called library.c 
it contain a main function 
for the application requirements
by default that file is the one that will be running for the application build using 
command ****************vip(make)vip*****************

7-mainApplication file contains different main functionality for testing all the application 
functioanlities in order for making anyone of them work , you got to remove any number beside any
main function that you want to run and put any number beside everyother main function .




************************************vip************************************

i have created a simple make file for the mainApplication

in order to run the mainApplication.c functionality that i talked about before
you got to remove the library.c file and put it.

in order to run the library.c file you got to remeove the mainApplication.c file 
and put the library.c 

by DEFAULT   the library.c is the one at the make file

in order to run the app 
just cd into the directory using your command line

then type make
then type finalProject
